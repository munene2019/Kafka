Here are the steps to configure Apache Kafka on a Windows machine:

Download the latest version of Kafka from the Apache Kafka website (https://kafka.apache.org/downloads).

Extract the downloaded file to a directory on your machine.

Open a Command Prompt and navigate to the Kafka directory.

Start the ZooKeeper server by running the following command: bin\windows\zookeeper-server-start.bat config\zookeeper.properties

Start the Kafka server by running the following command: bin\windows\kafka-server-start.bat config\server.properties

Create a topic by running the following command: bin\windows\kafka-topics.bat --create --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic <topic-name>

You can check if topic is created by running the following command: bin\windows\kafka-topics.bat --list --bootstrap-server localhost:9092

You can start a Kafka Consumer by running the following command: bin\windows\kafka-console-consumer.bat --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic <topic-name> --from-beginning

You can start a Kafka Producer by running the following command: bin\windows\kafka-console-producer.bat --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic <topic-name>

You should now have a basic Kafka setup running on your Windows machine, and you can start sending and receiving messages through the created topic.
It is important to note that these commands are basic examples, and you may need to add additional configurations and logic to your Kafka depending on your specific use case.
